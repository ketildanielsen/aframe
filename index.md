## Welcome to my learning to program using A-Frame site

### Boilerplate

A program is written in a program file.  We begin with a minimal file that contains no more than is absolutely strictly necessary to get started:  The "boilerplate" (and who gave it such a name?).  

```
<html>
   <head>
      <script src='https://aframe.io/releases/1.0.4/aframe.min.js'></script>
   </head>
   <body>
      <a-scene>
      </a-scene>
   </body>
</html>
```

We begin by printing messages to ourselves

# Remaining is not about A-Frrame
(it is the original content about how to use this github pages feature)

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/ketildanielsen/aframe/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/ketildanielsen/aframe/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
